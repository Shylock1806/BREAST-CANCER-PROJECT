# BREAST-CANCER-PROJECT
 In this project, public data about breast cancer tumors from Dr. William H. Walberg of the University of Wisconsin Hospital were taken and used for data visualization, classification, and machine learning algorithm. Public data included samples taken from patients with solid breast masses and a user-friendly usage of graphical programs called City. This study aimed to establish an adequate model by revealing the predictive factors of early-stage breast cancer patients from a wider perspective and compare the strength of the model with accuracy measures.
